  This command-line based tool is purely designed to meet my own needs. Your mileage may vary.  
  
  It was build and is used on Unix-like systems and requires `FFMPEG` to do the reencoding and `yt-dlp` to download. As such, any site|service that `yt-dlp` supports, is supported by `album_tools`.  
   
  My personal choice of sound file is Ogg Vorbis. If you'd like to use this tool, but prefer a different file format, adjust this in the `rip_tmp` and `batch_rip` shell scripts.  
    
  This started as a way for me to created a histogram of all the album dates in my collection, and grew into something else. (As often happens!)
